#Problem - A runner completes laps.They complete laps and earn points like: Lap 1 = 1 point,Lap 2 = 2 points,Lap 3 = 3 points etc.
#Find the total running points after n laps using three different solutions.

n = 5

#Solution 1 - Formula Method
#Algorithm - Use the formula n * (n + 1) // 2 to calculate points correctly

#Pseudocode:
#START
#    total = n * (n + 1) //2
#    print total
#END

formula_total = n * (n + 1) //2

#Add each lap number one by one.

#Pseudocode:

#   total = 0
#   for lap from 1 to n
#   total = total + lap
